      description: |-
        With SIP-connected audio, Zoom establishes a SIP trunk (a network connection specifically designed to make and deliver phone calls) over a direct and private connection between the customer’s network and the Zoom cloud. Meeting participants that dial into a meeting or have the meeting call them, and are On-Net from the perspective of the customers’ IP telephony network, will be connected over this trunk rather than over the PSTN.<br><br>
        Use this API to list all the SIP trunks assigned to a master account or a sub account of the master account. To retrieve SIP trunks assigned to a sub account, provide the account ID of the sub account in the `accountId` path parameter. To retrieve SIP trunks of a master account, provide `me` as the value of the `accountId` path parameter. <br><br> **Scope:** `sip_trunk:read:admin`
        <br><b>Prerequisites:</b><br>
        * The account must either be a master account or a sub account with [API Partner Plan](https://zoom.us/plan/api) and SIP Connected Audio Plan.

        Use this API to disassociate (unlink) a user or permanently delete a user. For user-level apps, pass [the `me` value](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/using-zoom-apis#mekeyword) instead of the `userId` parameter.

        **Deleting** a user **permanently** removes the user and their data from Zoom. Users can create a new Zoom account using the same email address. An account owner or an account admin can transfer meetings, webinars and cloud recordings to another Zoom user account before deleting.

        **Disassociating** a user unlinks the user from the associated Zoom account and provides the user their own basic free Zoom account. The disassociated user can then purchase their own Zoom licenses. An account owner or account admin can transfer the user's meetings, webinars, and cloud recordings to another user before disassociation.

        An account owner or admins can deactivate as well as activate a user in a Zoom account. Deactivating a user will remove all licenses associated with a user. It will prevent the deactivated user from logging into their Zoom account. A deactivated user can be reactivated. Reactivating a user grants the user access to login to their Zoom account.

      summary: Update a user's presence status
      description: |-
        Use this API to update a user's presence status. For user-level apps, pass [the `me` value](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/using-zoom-apis#mekeyword) instead of the `userId` parameter.

        A user's status **cannot** be updated more than once per minute. For example, you can only submit a maximum of one update request per minute for a single user.

        Users in the Zoom desktop client and mobile apps are assigned with a [presence status](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360032554051-Status-Icons). The presence status informs users of their contact's availability. Users can also change their own presence status to one the following:
        * **Away**
        * **Do not disturb**
        * **Available**
        * **In a calendar event**
        * **Presenting**
        * **In a Zoom meeting**
        * **On a call**

        Note that a user's presence status **cannot** be updated via this API if the user is not logged in to the Zoom client.

        If the [End of Meeting Feedback Survey](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005855266) option is enabled, attendees will be prompted with a survey window where they can tap either the **Thumbs Up** or **Thumbs Down** button that indicates their Zoom meeting experience. With this API, you can get information on the attendees' meeting satisfaction. Specify a monthly date range for the query using the from and to query parameters. The month should fall within the last six months.

        To get information on the survey results with negative experiences (indicated by **Thumbs Down**), use the [Get Zoom Meetings Client Feedback API](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api/dashboards/dashboardclientfeedbackdetail).<br>
